# Titanic Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project explores the ethical and communicative power of data visualization using the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains demographic and survival information for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including variables such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and survival status.

The primary objective of this project is two-fold:

1. **Create accurate and ethical visualizations** that clearly communicate meaningful survival patterns within the dataset.
2. **Create intentionally misleading visualizations** to demonstrate how design choices such as scale manipulation, selective filtering, or visual emphasis can distort interpretation.

The purpose of this project is to highlight how visualization design impacts audience perception and reinforces the importance of ethical responsibility in data communication.

## Primary Features to Explore

- Survival rates across passenger class
- Gender-based survival differences
- Age distribution and survival patterns
- Ethical implications of visualization design

This repository includes individual coding contributions, collaboration summaries, and the final report documenting both effective and misleading visualization approaches.
